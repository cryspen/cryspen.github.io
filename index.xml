library that implements essential language features like machine
arithmetic and I/O, offers efficient data structures, provides
interfaces to system libraries, etc. Although it is often overlooked,
this standard library should be considered as much part of the trusted
computing base (TCB) as the language compiler. Indeed, any bug in the standard
library is likely to break applications and could result in security vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Helping Secure Signal's Post-Quantum Transition</title><link>https://cryspen.com/post/signal-spqr-verification/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cryspen.com/post/signal-spqr-verification/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Signal just &lt;a href="https://signal.org/blog/spqr/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the deployment

At Cryspen, we&amp;rsquo;ve addressed this by implementing an automated, multi-platform benchmarking system. This post will detail the enhancements we&amp;rsquo;ve made to our workflows, allowing us to preemptively identify performance issues. Besides focusing on algorithm benchmarks, we utilize a tracing strategy for our protocol code. This method allows us to measure performance on live code. In addition, we will explore the tools and methods designed for creating comprehensive, informative visualizations of benchmark data, applicable to our wide range of projects and repositories.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Cryspen Welcomes Clement</title><link>https://cryspen.com/post/welcome_clement/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cryspen.com/post/welcome_clement/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The team here at Cryspen is thrilled to welcome to our newest member, Clement!&lt;/p&gt;

Certain kinds of programs can end up having a specification that is as complex
as the code itself.
In this case it is better to focus on more interesting and
understandable properties rather than an equivalence proof with a specification.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Cryspen Welcomes Clara</title><link>https://cryspen.com/post/welcome_clara/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cryspen.com/post/welcome_clara/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re thrilled to officially welcome Clara to the Cryspen team!

Some of these schemes, such as ML-KEM and ML-DSA, are currently in the &lt;a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/post-quantum-cryptography"&gt;final stages of standardizations by NIST&lt;/a&gt;. Before fully transitioning to post-quantum secure cryptography, an important first step many organizations are taking is protecting against &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_now,_decrypt_later"&gt;Harvest Now Decrypt Later (HNDL) attacks&lt;/a&gt;, where data is collected and stored today, and later decrypted once cryptanalysis improves.
Signal recently introduced &lt;a href="https://cryspen.com/post/pqxdh/"&gt;PQXDH&lt;/a&gt;, which protects against these attacks.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Three may keep a secret, if two of them are dead.”&lt;/em&gt; - Benjamin Franklin (1735)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However skeptical we may be of our human ability to keep secrets, we still routinely participate in group conversations that we would like to keep away from prying eyes. We exchange confidential work emails through corporate mail servers, discuss project internals on private Slacks, and exchange deeply personal information with family and friends on WhatsApp groups. The loss of this private data to malicious outsiders can result in public embarrassment, financial loss, and for vulnerable persons like journalists or activists, even threats to life and liberty.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>MLS - RFC 9420</title><link>https://cryspen.com/post/mls-rfc-announcement/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cryspen.com/post/mls-rfc-announcement/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;✨ We are thrilled to announce the release of the MLS specification as &lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9420"&gt;RFC 9420&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9420"&gt;RFC 9420&lt;/a&gt; is a comprehensive description of the first standardised, efficient, asynchronous, key establishment protocol with forward secrecy and post-compromise security for groups in size ranging from two to thousands. While Cryspen didn&amp;rsquo;t exist back when the MLS working group was established, our co-founder Karthik played a pivotal role in designing MLS from the beginning by contributing to the original design of &lt;a href="https://inria.hal.science/hal-02425247/file/treekem+(1).pdf"&gt;TreeKEM&lt;/a&gt;, the basis of MLS today.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Welcome Jonas</title><link>https://cryspen.com/post/welcome_jonas/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cryspen.com/post/welcome_jonas/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;📢 Exciting News! 🚀 We are thrilled to welcome Dr. Jonas Schneider-Bensch, to the Cryspen family as our newest R&amp;amp;D Cryptography Engineer!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Cryspen @ RWC 2023</title><link>https://cryspen.com/post/rwc-2023/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cryspen.com/post/rwc-2023/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;At Real World Crypto 2023 in Tokyo, we gave a talk on the hacspec language, the hax tool, and the libcrux crypto library.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>About Cryspen</title><link>https://cryspen.com/about/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cryspen.com/about/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Cryspen was founded in December 2021 by Franziskus Kiefer, Karthikeyan

The libraries are based on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/hacl-star/hacl-star"&gt;HACL*&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://project-everest.github.io/"&gt;research project&lt;/a&gt;, originally developed by Inria

verifiable specifications for cryptographic components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Syntactically, hacspec is a purely functional subset of Rust that aims to be
readable by developers, cryptographers, and verification experts.
An application developer can use hacspec to specify and prototype cryptographic
components in Rust, and then replace this specification with a verified
implementation before deployment.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>High Assurance Software Toolchain</title><link>https://cryspen.com/circus/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cryspen.com/circus/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Cryspen collaborates with the Prosecco team at Inria to develop a usable, robust,

plaintexts for a recipient public key.
It includes three authenticated variants, including one which authenticates
possession of a pre-shared key, and two optional ones which authenticate
possession of a KEM private key.
HPKE works for any combination of an asymmetric key encapsulation mechanism (KEM), key derivation function (KDF), and authenticated encryption with additional data (AEAD) encryption function.
Some authenticated variants may not be supported by all KEMs.
We provide instantiations of the scheme using widely used and efficient primitives, such as Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key agreement, HKDF, and SHA2.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Impressum</title><link>https://cryspen.com/imprint/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cryspen.com/imprint/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Company Name: Cryspen Sarl&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://messaginglayersecurity.rocks/mls-protocol/draft-ietf-mls-protocol.html"&gt;MLS protocol&lt;/a&gt; draft is in the IETF working group&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/mls/bOhxmpo70T-ikDd40OqQfst64gE/"&gt;last call&lt;/a&gt; and is thus
on track to become an RFC soon.
We want to make sure that OpenMLS is ready for wider adoption by the time the
RFC is ready.
To achieve this we start by catching up with all the changes to the protocol
(up to the current draft-16), improving test coverage of the code, and working
towards a more comprehensive test framework for interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>HACL Packages</title><link>https://cryspen.com/post/introducing-hacl-packages/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cryspen.com/post/introducing-hacl-packages/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://tezos.foundation/"&gt;Tezos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nomadic-labs.com/"&gt;Nomadic Labs&lt;/a&gt; started to work with Cryspen to
