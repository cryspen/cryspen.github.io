Some of these schemes, such as ML-KEM and ML-DSA, are currently in the &lt;a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/post-quantum-cryptography">final stages of standardizations by NIST&lt;/a>. Before fully transitioning to post-quantum secure cryptography, an important first step many organizations are taking is protecting against &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_now,_decrypt_later">Harvest Now Decrypt Later (HNDL) attacks&lt;/a>, where data is collected and stored today, and later decrypted once cryptanalysis improves.

verifiable specifications for cryptographic components.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Syntactically, hacspec is a purely functional subset of Rust that aims to be
readable by developers, cryptographers, and verification experts.
An application developer can use hacspec to specify and prototype cryptographic
components in Rust, and then replace this specification with a verified
implementation before deployment.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>High Assurance Software Toolchain</title><link>https://cryspen.com/circus/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cryspen.com/circus/</guid><description>&lt;p>Cryspen collaborates with the Prosecco team at Inria to develop a usable, robust,

plaintexts for a recipient public key.
It includes three authenticated variants, including one which authenticates
possession of a pre-shared key, and two optional ones which authenticate
possession of a KEM private key.
HPKE works for any combination of an asymmetric key encapsulation mechanism (KEM), key derivation function (KDF), and authenticated encryption with additional data (AEAD) encryption function.
Some authenticated variants may not be supported by all KEMs.
We provide instantiations of the scheme using widely used and efficient primitives, such as Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key agreement, HKDF, and SHA2.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Impressum</title><link>https://cryspen.com/imprint/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cryspen.com/imprint/</guid><description>&lt;p>Company Name: Cryspen Sarl&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://messaginglayersecurity.rocks/mls-protocol/draft-ietf-mls-protocol.html">MLS protocol&lt;/a> draft is in the IETF working group&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/mls/bOhxmpo70T-ikDd40OqQfst64gE/">last call&lt;/a> and is thus
on track to become an RFC soon.
We want to make sure that OpenMLS is ready for wider adoption by the time the
RFC is ready.
To achieve this we start by catching up with all the changes to the protocol
(up to the current draft-16), improving test coverage of the code, and working
towards a more comprehensive test framework for interoperability.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>HACL Packages</title><link>https://cryspen.com/post/introducing-hacl-packages/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cryspen.com/post/introducing-hacl-packages/</guid><description>&lt;p>Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://tezos.foundation/">Tezos&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.nomadic-labs.com/">Nomadic Labs&lt;/a> started to work with Cryspen to
