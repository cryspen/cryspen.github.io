      <description>Security protocols and constructions are pervasive. Some are well-known, like TLS; but your organization may be using custom security mechanisms for identity management, key propagation, secure storageâ€¦ Having complete confidence in such a design requires an in-depth security analysis that covers side-channels, cryptographic design, and software design.</description>
