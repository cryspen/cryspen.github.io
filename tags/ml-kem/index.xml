Since August 13, 2024, FIPS has standardized Kyber as ML-KEM in &lt;a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/203/final">FIPS 203&lt;/a> for PQ encryption, Dilithium as ML-DSA and and SPHINCS+ as SLH-DSA in &lt;a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/204/final">FIPS 204&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/205/final">FIPS 205&lt;/a>, respectively, for PQ digital signatures. Read more on how we at Cryspen are building formally verified implementations of these standards, &lt;a href="https://cryspen.com/post/fospqc/">previously on this blog&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
