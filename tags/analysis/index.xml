&lt;p>Signal recently &lt;a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/pqxdh/">published&lt;/a> a new, post-quantum secure, version of their &lt;a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/x3dh/">X3DH&lt;/a> protocol called &lt;a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/pqxdh/">PQXDH&lt;/a>. As with any new cryptographic protocol, it is important to precisely analyse its security properties, especially for something as important as Signal.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
