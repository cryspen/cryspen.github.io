This first official publication of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) standards represents a significant step forward in securing the Internet, and organizations across the globe, against the future threat of quantum computers.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>High Assurance IoT PQC</title><link>https://cryspen.com/post/pqc-iot-announce/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cryspen.com/post/pqc-iot-announce/</guid><description>&lt;p>Together with our sister-company &lt;a href="https://cryptoeng.de">CryptoEng&lt;/a>, we extend our &lt;a href="https://github.com/cryspen/libcrux">libcrux&lt;/a> cryptographic
library with support for resource constrained IoT devices.
Read &lt;a href="https://cryptoeng.de/blog/posts/iot-pqc-announce/">their announcement here&lt;/a>.
The libcrux-iot library contains high performance, high assurance implementations of post-quantum, as well as classical, cryptographic primitives.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Conference Talks</title><link>https://cryspen.com/post/rwc2024/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cryspen.com/post/rwc2024/</guid><description>&lt;p>Cryspen attended a number of conference in April and March.

&lt;p>In &lt;a href="https://github.com/openmls/openmls/pull/1546">#1546&lt;/a> we merged support for the &lt;a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-connolly-cfrg-xwing-kem-02.html">X-Wing KEM draft&lt;/a>, which is an early draft for securely combining elliptic-curve-based Diffie-Hellman with ML-KEM. In particular, OpenMLS now supports the ciphersuite MLS_256_XWING_CHACHA20POLY1305_SHA256_Ed25519 with ciphersuite 0x004D. There is no IANA code-point for this ciphersuite yet, such that interoperability may not be guaranteed. We work with other implementers towards interoperability of this ciphersuite.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Post-Quantum Group Messaging</title><link>https://cryspen.com/post/pq-mls/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cryspen.com/post/pq-mls/</guid><description>&lt;p>With multiple post-quantum cryptographic algorithms (&lt;a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/203/ipd">ML-KEM&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/204/ipd">ML-DSA&lt;/a>) nearing standardization, enterprises, research groups, and standards bodies have started investigating what post-quantum secure protocols should look like and what properties they should satisfy.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
