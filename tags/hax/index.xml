library that implements essential language features like machine
arithmetic and I/O, offers efficient data structures, provides
interfaces to system libraries, etc. Although it is often overlooked,
this standard library should be considered as much part of the trusted
computing base (TCB) as the language compiler. Indeed, any bug in the standard
library is likely to break applications and could result in security vulnerabilities.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Helping Secure Signal's Post-Quantum Transition</title><link>https://cryspen.com/post/signal-spqr-verification/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cryspen.com/post/signal-spqr-verification/</guid><description>&lt;p>Signal just &lt;a href="https://signal.org/blog/spqr/">announced&lt;/a> the deployment

Certain kinds of programs can end up having a specification that is as complex
as the code itself.
In this case it is better to focus on more interesting and
understandable properties rather than an equivalence proof with a specification.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cryspen @ VSTTE 2024</title><link>https://cryspen.com/post/vstte2024/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cryspen.com/post/vstte2024/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.soundandcomplete.org/vstte2024.html">Verified Software: Theories, Tools, and Experiments&lt;/a>
