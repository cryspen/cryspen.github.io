&lt;p&gt;Cryptographic protocols, which exclusively rely on classical public key cryptography for establishing shared secrets, may be vulnerable to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_now%2C_decrypt_later"&gt;harvest-now-decrypt-later&lt;/a&gt; (HNDL) quantum attacks.
However, many protocols in widespread use today allow injecting a previously established pre-shared key (PSK) into the computation of the shared secret. If we can establish this pre-shared key in a way that is secure against HNDL attackers, we can provide an easy way of protecting many applications without having to touch their internals.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
