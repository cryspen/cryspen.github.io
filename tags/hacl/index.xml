The libraries are based on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/hacl-star/hacl-star">HACL*&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://project-everest.github.io/">research project&lt;/a>, originally developed by Inria
and Microsoft Research.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>libcrux</title><link>https://cryspen.com/libcrux/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cryspen.com/libcrux/</guid><description>&lt;p>Libcrux is a formally verified cryptographic library that brings together verified
artifacts from different sources. It uses &lt;a href="https://cryspen.com/hacspec/">hacspec&lt;/a>
as a common language for the specifications underlying the correctness and security
proofs. Libcrux is written in Rust, a modern programming language that is known
for its safety and performance. Underneath, it uses verified Rust, C, and Assembly code.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>HACL Packages v0.6</title><link>https://cryspen.com/post/hacl-0_6/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cryspen.com/post/hacl-0_6/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Today, we announce the first release of the HACL Packages libraries. 🎉&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This release of HACL packages includes the first release of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/cryspen/hacl-packages/releases/tag/c-v0.6.0">HACL C library&lt;/a>
and a new release of the &lt;a href="https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/hacl-star/">hacl-star OCaml&lt;/a> bindings.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>HACL Packages</title><link>https://cryspen.com/post/introducing-hacl-packages/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cryspen.com/post/introducing-hacl-packages/</guid><description>&lt;p>Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://tezos.foundation/">Tezos&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.nomadic-labs.com/">Nomadic Labs&lt;/a> started to work with Cryspen to
improve &lt;a href="https://hacl-star.github.io/">HACL*&lt;/a> and ensure that it is a viable long-term solution for Tezos'
cryptographic needs.
HACL is a set of high assurance cryptographic primitives used by Tezos for most
of its cryptography.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
