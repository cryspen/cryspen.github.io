ever-increasing amounts of data are being collected, stored, communicated,
combined, and computed over by sophisticated algorithms.
In parallel, new governmental regulations and rising concerns about privacy are
giving impetus to new research on how to protect the confidentiality, integrity
and privacy of all this data.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cryspen @ RWC 2023</title><link>https://cryspen.com/post/rwc-2023/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cryspen.com/post/rwc-2023/</guid><description>&lt;p>At Real World Crypto 2023 in Tokyo, we gave a talk on the hacspec language, the hax tool, and the libcrux crypto library.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>hacspec</title><link>https://cryspen.com/hacspec/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cryspen.com/hacspec/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://hacspec.org">hacspec&lt;/a> is a language and framework for writing succinct, executable, formally
verifiable specifications for cryptographic components.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Syntactically, hacspec is a purely functional subset of Rust that aims to be
readable by developers, cryptographers, and verification experts.
An application developer can use hacspec to specify and prototype cryptographic
components in Rust, and then replace this specification with a verified
implementation before deployment.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>libcrux</title><link>https://cryspen.com/libcrux/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cryspen.com/libcrux/</guid><description>&lt;p>Libcrux is a formally verified cryptographic library that brings together verified
artifacts from different sources. It uses &lt;a href="https://cryspen.com/hacspec/">hacspec&lt;/a>
as a common language for the specifications underlying the correctness and security
proofs. Libcrux is written in Rust, a modern programming language that is known
for its safety and performance. Underneath, it uses verified Rust, C, and Assembly code.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>An Executable HPKE Specification</title><link>https://cryspen.com/post/hpke_spec/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cryspen.com/post/hpke_spec/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-hpke/">HPKE&lt;/a>, published as &lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-hpke/">RFC 9180&lt;/a>, describes a scheme for hybrid public key encryption.&lt;/p>
