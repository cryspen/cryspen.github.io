At Cryspen, we&amp;rsquo;ve addressed this by implementing an automated, multi-platform benchmarking system. This post will detail the enhancements we&amp;rsquo;ve made to our workflows, allowing us to preemptively identify performance issues. Besides focusing on algorithm benchmarks, we utilize a tracing strategy for our protocol code. This method allows us to measure performance on live code. In addition, we will explore the tools and methods designed for creating comprehensive, informative visualizations of benchmark data, applicable to our wide range of projects and repositories.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cryspen @ RWC 2025</title><link>https://cryspen.com/post/rwc-2025/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cryspen.com/post/rwc-2025/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://rwc.iacr.org/2025/">Real World Crypto 2025&lt;/a> buzzed with energy as
the cutting edge of cryptography was presented to and discussed among an audience of leading
researchers and developers from academia and industry. Today, on the second day of the conference,
Cryspen teamed up with Google to showcase practical, scalable, verified solutions
for high-assurance software and post-quantum cryptography.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cryspen @ VSTTE 2024</title><link>https://cryspen.com/post/vstte2024/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cryspen.com/post/vstte2024/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.soundandcomplete.org/vstte2024.html">Verified Software: Theories, Tools, and Experiments&lt;/a>
