library that implements essential language features like machine
arithmetic and I/O, offers efficient data structures, provides
interfaces to system libraries, etc. Although it is often overlooked,
this standard library should be considered as much part of the trusted
computing base (TCB) as the language compiler. Indeed, any bug in the standard
library is likely to break applications and could result in security vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
