Since August 13, 2024, FIPS has standardized Kyber as ML-KEM in &lt;a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/203/final">FIPS 203&lt;/a> for PQ encryption, Dilithium as ML-DSA and and SPHINCS+ as SLH-DSA in &lt;a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/204/final">FIPS 204&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/205/final">FIPS 205&lt;/a>, respectively, for PQ digital signatures.

Some of these schemes, such as ML-KEM and ML-DSA, are currently in the &lt;a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/post-quantum-cryptography">final stages of standardizations by NIST&lt;/a>. Before fully transitioning to post-quantum secure cryptography, an important first step many organizations are taking is protecting against &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_now,_decrypt_later">Harvest Now Decrypt Later (HNDL) attacks&lt;/a>, where data is collected and stored today, and later decrypted once cryptanalysis improves.
Signal recently introduced &lt;a href="https://cryspen.com/post/pqxdh/">PQXDH&lt;/a>, which protects against these attacks.
