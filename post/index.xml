Some of these schemes, such as ML-KEM and ML-DSA, are currently in the &lt;a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/post-quantum-cryptography">final stages of standardizations by NIST&lt;/a>. Before fully transitioning to post-quantum secure cryptography, an important first step many organizations are taking is protecting against &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_now,_decrypt_later">Harvest Now Decrypt Later (HNDL) attacks&lt;/a>, where data is collected and stored today, and later decrypted once cryptanalysis improves.
Signal recently introduced &lt;a href="https://cryspen.com/post/pqxdh/">PQXDH&lt;/a>, which protects against these attacks.
